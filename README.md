The proposed idea involves developing a mobile application using the Flutter framework that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its core machine learning model. The app aims to identify plant diseases through the device's camera by capturing images of plants and analyzing them using the CNN model. This innovative solution would provide users with real-time and accurate disease diagnosis, enabling timely interventions to prevent crop loss and promote sustainable agriculture practices.
